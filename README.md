### Abstract

 Structural failures are often caused by catastrophic events such as earthquakes and winds. As a result, it is crucial
to predict dynamic stress distributions during highly disruptive events in real time. Currently available high-fidelity
methods, such as Finite Element Models (FEMs), super from their inherent high complexity. Therefore, to reduce
computational cost while maintaining accuracy, a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN), PINN-Stress model,
is proposed to predict the entire sequence of stress distribution based on Finite Element simulations using a partial
diferential equation (PDE) solver. Using automatic diferentiation, we embed a PDE into a deep neural networkâ€™s loss
function to incorporate information from measurements and PDEs. The PINN-Stress model can predict the sequence
of stress distribution in almost real-time and can generalize better than the model without PINN.
